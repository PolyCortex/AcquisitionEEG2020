The project contained in this repository is a 4-channel prototype board produced in the development of a PCB to acquire EEG signals. It contains an instrumentation amplifier, a notch filter and an anti aliasing filter. It is designed to be sampled either in a lab with the help of an oscilloscope or with a computer through a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller development board.

**Disclaimer:** This prototype board does not work to sample EEG signals and was never intended as such. It was meant to be a platform used to test designs of filtering and amplification circuits, which we would have integrated into a true production PCB. However, our development cycle was slowed down due to the pandemic and we had to plan the release of the production version of the board for April 2021 instead. Even though we did not finish the project, we still wanted to show our progress and so we submit this prototype for the NeuroTechX 2020 Fixed Challenge.
